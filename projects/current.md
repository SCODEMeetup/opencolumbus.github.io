### Description
The goal of this project is to provide a fun, entertaining, interactive way for people to identify and catalog infrastructure such as roadways, sidewalks, signs, and street lights. 

Trackers will have the opportunity to identify "monsters". Monsters are those things that are ultimately issues related to infrastructure such as cracked roadways, potholes, lights that are out, etc. Trackers will be awarded points for capturing monsters.

However, trackers can also identify "heroes" as well. Heroes are infrastructure that are in good condition. For instance, sidewalks that are not in need of repair, or signs that are not damaged. Again, trackers will earn points for making friends with these as well. In addition, if a tracker has previously identified an asset as a monster, and it is now a hero, they will receive points for helping the monster in its "redemption arch".

### Details

Problem - While pedestrian routing algorithms are getting faster and more informative, planning a route with a wheeled device in urban centers is difficult due to lack of integrated pertinent information regarding accessibility along the route. To adequately plan a commute, a traveler with limited or wheeled mobility must know whether her path may be blocked by construction, whether the sidewalk would be too steep or rendered unusable due to poor conditions, whether the street can be crossed or a highway is blocking the way, or whether there is a sidewalk at all. These details populate different datasets in many modern municipalities, but they are not immediately available in a convenient, integrated format to be useful to people with limited mobility. 

The solution in Columbus is Project Sidewalk. First developed by the University of Washington, volunteers in any city can now label their streets by virtually exploring them and adding labels like Curb ramps conditions, sidewalk obstacles and surface conditions. This data will allow cities in improving city planning, building accessibility aware mapping tools and train machine learning algorithms to automatically find accessibility issues.
