## What we're about

We are community-based enthusiasts focused on the [Smart Columbus](https://www.columbus.gov/smartcolumbus/home/) initiative. Visit our [website](https://www.scodemeetup.org/) for more information.

We will be continuing the momentum from the [2018 Hackathon]( http://hackscos.com ). Our goals are to enable community participation in areas of BI/Analytics, Data analysis / Visualization and software development. Check out the hackathon [review](https://youtu.be/appq0fQceP8) video!

## Our Goals:

1. Create a community that provides freedom to connect, learn, innovate and collaborate.
