## What we're about

We are community-based enthusiasts focused on the [Smart Columbus](https://www.columbus.gov/smartcolumbus/home/) initiative. Visit our [website](https://www.scodemeetup.org/) for more information.

We will be continuing the momentum from the [2018 Hackathon]( http://hackscos.com ). Our goals are to enable community participation in areas of BI/Analytics, Data analysis / Visualization and software development. Check out the hackathon [review](https://youtu.be/appq0fQceP8) video!

Promoting Smart Columbus [open datasets](https://www.smartcolumbusos.com/data) to solve challenges related to the quality of life and economic growth of Columbus.

## When and where we meet

The group meets on a monthly cadence. The current cadence is the second Tuesday of the month. The location we meet will vary based on a number of factors:

1. We try to host at companies already involved in Smart City Columbus in some way
1. We try to roam the meeting space around based on where people live
   * basically we look around the i270 loop
   * central downtown
1. Event spaces willing to donate space ;)

## Our Goals:

1. Create a community that provides freedom to connect, learn, innovate and collaborate.
1. Encourage participation by providing data, tools, and education.
1. Serve as a reliable means of communication between Smart Columbus and the community.
