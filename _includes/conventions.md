### Conventions used

We use inline `code snippets` for short commands or pieces of code, and also for file and folder names on a system.

Larger pieces of code will be shown in their own block, where possible with syntax highlighting.

```
This is a block of code without an associated language.
In general, code blocks have the same left-hand border colour.
```

There is one main variation for code blocks.

```bash
$ This is a block of command line code, using bash syntax highlighting.
$ The command line blocks use a different left-hand border colour.
$ Usually, a command line begins with '$ '.
```

There are a few ways to highlight a paragraph.

{:.warning}

A warning block offers information about potential pitfalls or errors.

{:.info}

An info block provides important hints or pointers.
