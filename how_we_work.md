## High-level of meetings throughout a year

1. [Planning sessions](planning-sessions)
1. [Topic collection / whats next planning](#topic-collection--whats-next-planning)
1. [Normal meetings](#normal-meetings)

## Normal meetings

The flow of each meeting is fairly straight-forward:

1. First 15 minutes split
   * Event introduction
   * Wifi and location call-outs, thanks etc
1. 5-15 minutes with a representative from Smart City Columbus, if any
   * Idea here is whatever public announcements they want to broadcast
   * Product / feature information, demonstrations etc
1. 20-30 minutes for the [teams](https://github.com/orgs/SCODEMeetup/teams)
   * This is intended to be total but usually runs over ;)
   * The ideas for topics:
      1. Demonstrations
      1. Call for help
      1. Next steps
      1. etc...
1. 60-90 minutes for team breakouts
   * Planning
   * Retrospective / review of work
   * Collaboration and hacking on stuff

## Planning sessions

Planning sessions are where we refine a chosen topic / idea. The ideas here, in no particular order, are enumerated below.

1. Take input from stake-holders
1. Discuss what the attendees are thinking about #1 above ;)
1. See where those conversations go - its hard to describe but when things start to gel and we are building out

Our expected outcome from this kind of session is formation of teams ( or at least validation we need the existing ) along with collection of cards. These cards will eventually turn into issues on one / more of our [repos](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup).

## Topic collection / whats next planning

The topic collection phase is how we figure out what, as a community, we want to work on. The expected output is something similar to what we did for our initial [kickoff](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/meeting_notes/blob/master/2018-06-07/Meetup%20talking%20points%20metrics.md#group-use-case-ideas). The second topic collection produced another [set](https://github.com/SCODEMeetup/meeting_notes/blob/master/2019-02-12/talkcoffee.md) which will next be going through the planning session as a compare/contrast.
